# Lab 5 - Map e-documents to purchase order lines with Copilot in Dynamics 365 Business Central

**Introduction**

In this lab, participants explore how e-documents are processed and
mapped to purchase orders in Dynamics 365 Business Central using
Copilot. The lab begins by accessing a sandbox environment and
generating the required demo data using the Contoso Demo Tool.
Participants then work with linked purchase orders created from
e-documents and learn how Copilot assists in matching e-document lines
with purchase order lines. Through hands-on exercises, participants gain
practical experience in reviewing, validating, and saving
Copilot-generated matches, while also understanding the different
matching options available within the e-document mapping process.

## Task 1: Open Business Central Admin Center and Access Sandbox Environment

1.  Navigate to the Business Central home page.

2.  From the top bar, select **Settings**, and then choose **Admin

**Conclusion**

By completing this lab, participants gain a practical understanding of
how Copilot enhances the e-document mapping experience in Dynamics 365
Business Central. Participants successfully generated demo data,
reviewed linked purchase orders, and used Copilot to automatically match
e-document lines with purchase order lines. They also explored different
matching scenarios, including reviewing and discarding matches to better
understand the available options. This lab demonstrates how Copilot can
reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and streamline procurement
workflows by simplifying the process of mapping vendor e-documents to
purchase orders.
