# Lab 6 - Creating and Enhancing Item Marketing Text with Copilot in Business Central​

**Lab Objective**

In this lab, you will learn how to use Copilot in Microsoft Dynamics 365
Business Central to generate, review, and refine marketing text for an
existing item. You will start by opening an item card, generate an
AI-powered first draft using Copilot, customize the content by selecting
relevant attributes, and then review, edit, and save the final version.

This lab demonstrates how AI can accelerate content creation while still
requiring human validation to ensure quality, accuracy, and brand
alignment.

## Exercise 1: Generate the First Draft with Copilot
